# AyoThai Massage website

This repository contains a small static site for AyoThai Massage (built for GitHub Pages).

Files:
- `index.html` — main site content
- `assets/css/styles.css` — styling
- `assets/js/main.js` — small JS for mobile nav + testimonial carousel

Quick setup
1. Replace placeholder images and text (logo, address, phone, hours).
2. Update the Formspree form action in the contact form (`action="https://formspree.io/f/your-form-id"`) or swap for your booking provider (Calendly, Square, Acuity, etc.).
3. Commit and push to the `main` branch. If your repository is named `ayothai.github.io` (or `AyoThai.github.io`), GitHub Pages will serve the site at `https://ayothai.github.io/`.

Deployment tips
- Add a `CNAME` file with your custom domain if needed.
- Add alt attributes to any inline `<img>` tags you add for accessibility.
- Replace Google Maps iframe with your exact location link (or remove if you prefer).
- Consider adding a favicon and meta Open Graph tags for social sharing.

If you want, I can:
- Help customize copy, images, or color palette.
- Add a booking integration (Calendly, Square) or set up Formspree with a working form id.
- Suggest SEO and accessibility improvements.
